## 🎮 Game Description :-
Balloon Pop Challenge is an interactive browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
In this game, balloons appear on the screen and slowly float upward. The player must click and pop the balloons before they float away.

The objective is simple: **pop balloons as they appear on screen and pop them before they float away**.  
The game becomes more challenging as balloons continue to appear, testing the player’s speed and attention.
